# My Projects (Data Analysis)
### The above projects are parts of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program (Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science Scholarship Program), and here a short description of each one:

* Explore Weather Trends:
  - In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global           temperature trends. I used SQL to extract data from the temperatures database, created visualizations (using Excel) and prepared a         write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city     to where I live.
 
  
* Bike Share Analysis: 
  - In this project, I explored data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States: New York City,       Chicago, and Washington, DC, performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute         descriptive statistics. Moreover, I have used visualization as part of the exploration.
 

* Investigate a Dataset:
  - In this project, I conducted my own data analysis using a random dataset (data regarding 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil) and         created a file to share my findings. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using       it. Then used pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, to answer the questions I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the             answers. I went through the data analysis process: Ask questions, Wrangling the data, Performing EDA, Drawing conclusions and             Communicating the results).
